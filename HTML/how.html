      Here I will show you code snippets and what they do. The development of the website began with something I liked when I was making my first website (this is already my third) using video tutorials.
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
        <img
          src="mercedes.png"
          alt="My Photo"
          style="width: 600px; border-radius: 15px; border: 5px solid #434444"
        />
        <img
          src="git.png"
          alt="My Photo"
          style="width: 500px; border-radius: 15px; border: 5px solid #434444"
        />
        <p>Here you can see a round frame with shadows. It was surprisingly easy to make. On the right is a snippet of code that made it possible. It was all done thanks to the connected Bootstrap library. I wrote most of the code myself, but since it was linked to the library, it was easier to do. But my advice is that it's better to do it yourself. </p>

        <img
          src="button.png"
          alt="My Photo"
          style="width: 600px; border-radius: 15px; border: 5px solid #434444"
        />
        <img
          src="code2.png"
          alt="My Photo"
          style="width: 600px; border-radius: 15px; border: 5px solid #434444"
        />
        <p>These are hyperlinks that allow you to navigate to a website when clicked. Their design also depends on the connected Bootstrap library. Writing a working button is very, very easy, so you can make the entire website out of hyperlinks :) </p>
